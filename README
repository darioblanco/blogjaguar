Although Apache Software License doesn't require to distribute the source
code, I think that it might be useful to share my work with other
developers or people who want to try Django like I did.

Any feedback about the code, improvement, security issue or question can
be directed to my email address: dblancoit@gmail.com

TODO
- Login with twitter, google+, yahoo id.
- Own search engine.
- Photo gallery app (related with the blog entries).
- Syntax highlighting for pasting code in blog entries.
- Better entry and comment system.
- Better manual and code documentation.
- Study the use of Django Generic Views (it was my first approach to the Django view
system and it could be significantly improved).
- Adding to the Dojo Rich Text Editor youtube and video functions.
- File explorer.
