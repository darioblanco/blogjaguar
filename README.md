Although Apache Software License doesn't require to distribute the source
code, I think that it might be useful to share my work with other
developers or people who want to try Django like I did.

# DEPENDENCIES
Pygments (http://pygments.org/) 

    sudo easy_install Pygments


# THINGS TO IMPROVE (it was my first Django app)
* Use of Django paginator instead of my own paginator system (blogpage.py)
* Use of Django comments system instead of my own comments system


# TODO
* Login with twitter, google+, yahoo id.
* Own search engine.
* Photo gallery app (related with the blog entries).
* Better entry and comment system.
* Better manual and code documentation.
* Study the use of Django Generic Views (it was my first approach to the Django view
system and it could be significantly improved).
* Adding youtube and video functions to the Dojo Rich Text Editor.
* File explorer.
